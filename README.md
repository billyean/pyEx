Haibo's Python Code

Python is one of easiest programming language but it has some many language features. It will be nice to capture all the learning I had by studying in PluralSight, Coursera, SafariBookOnline and self paced study. I am trying to capture all the code I had for python programming but also all the experiments by playing Python source code here. Python has many useful library as well. It will be so nice to try different kind of library.

* Python Fundamental
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Python Source
