# Installation

By default, Pycharm will create a virutal env that doesn't contain numpy. We have to install numpy before using it in 
this virtual env. Go Pycharm's left-bottom corner, click the computer icon then Terminal, open terminal window, and 
input as follows and you're good to go.

<pre><code>
pip3 install scipy numpy
</code></pre>
